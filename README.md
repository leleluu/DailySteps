# Daily Steps 👟

**Overview** 🗺

This is a daily step counter app written in **SwiftUI**, with **HealthKit** integration for accurate step count data collection. I created this app to showcase some of the core concepts of SwiftUI in regards to view composition and data flow 😊.

**Improvement Areas 🧐**

The edit goal button would be too small according to Human Interface Guidelines but I decided to keep this out of scope because I wanted to focus on UI composition and data flow.
